Magic Card Trick Algorithm - README

Overview:

This project is based on a classic card trick that involves 3 piles of cards. The trick's mechanics are as follows:

1. The magician divides a deck of cards into three piles.
2. The participant selects a card from one of the piles.
3. The magician then gathers the piles together with the selected card's pile placed in the center.
4. The piles are redistributed into three new piles, and the process is repeated three times.
5. After three iterations, the selected card will always be in the 11th position, or the fourth card in the center pile.
6. The code implements this trick using a simulation in Python, where it runs through iterations, orders columns, and tracks the card's position. It models the card trick algorithmically and ensures that the selected card always ends up in the predicted position.
